# EightQueens

The following is a java solution to the famous Eight Queens problem. 
This code was developed as part of my personal learning process along 
with the Code Clinic course on Lynda.com. 

NOTE:
The actual java code can be found in the "src" folder. 
This code was developed using the Eclipse IDE. 
Eclipse auto-generates XML metadata and a folder structure when creating a new project.
